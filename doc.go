// Kankuro is built on top of the Airbyte go-sdk/cdk built by bitstrapped (https://github.com/bitstrapped/airbyte)
// Kankuro is meant to help build connectors quickly in go
// Words extracted from base package:
// "This package abstracts away much of the "protocol" away from the user and lets them focus on biz logic
// It focuses on developer efficiency and tries to be strongly typed as much as possible to help dev's move fast without mistakes"
// Thanks a lot to bitstrapped and contributors
